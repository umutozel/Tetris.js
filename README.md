Tetris.js
=========

A simple tetris with javascript and HTML5 Canvas.

I was playing with HTML5 canvas, suddenly I wanted to code a tetris and it easily turned into a challange: how short can I do this?

I know code is not clear, not fast, not bullet-proof (I intentionally removed some performance improvements and error check codes).

But it was fun coding :)
