Tetris.js
=========

######A simple tetris with javascript and HTML5 Canvas.

######I was playing with HTML5 canvas, suddenly I wanted to code a tetris and it easily turn into a challange: how short can I do this?
######This is the result, 48 lines of javascript.
######I know code is not clear, not fast, not bullet-proof (I intentionally removed some performance improvements and error check codes).
